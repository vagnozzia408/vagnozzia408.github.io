												<p>
													The Fall 2020 semester brought with it a unique set of challenges in higher education. For me, those challenges often translated to Zoom crashes, Canvas outages, internet connectivity issues, and webcam malfunctions. But these paled in comparison to what seemed a monumental task of providing students with a valuable online academic experience. Despite not being able to come to campus and the stress of being in a global pandemic, I wanted students to still walk away from this semester feeling not only that they learned something, but also that they were supported in their learning and valued in the virtual classroom.
												</p>
												<p>
													Each semester, I keep a reflection journal on my teaching experience. I am constantly learning new things about my personal teaching practice that I can apply to future semesters, and this process seemed especially valuable this year given the unusual nature of the semester. For many students and faculty alike, this was the first time we faced a fully online college experience. Given that COVID-19 isn’t going away anytime soon, figuring out what works (or doesn’t) to help students thrive in the online environment is of critical importance to me as an instructor. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I firmly believe that no person is an island when it comes to teaching, so I’m sharing my experience with the hope that other professors teaching online courses will find it valuable.	Here’s what I learned while teaching online synchronous statistics courses during a pandemic.
												</p>
											
												<h3>Organization is key.</h3>
												<p>
													Students often shared how much they appreciated having a Canvas course that was organized and easily navigable. For my courses, I created one Canvas page for each week of class that included lecture materials, assignments, and due dates organized in a table. My goal was to minimize the number of clicks they needed to find any relevant material, and students commented multiple times throughout the semester that they loved that they could find everything in one place. Heck, it helped me stay organized, too. 
												</p>
											
												<h3>Post materials early.</h3>
												<p>
													As a professor, this can be a huge ask, especially when many of us are creating online materials (such as lecture videos) from scratch. It’s a massive time investment. Whenever possible, however, I found it valuable to post materials roughly a week in advance of their associated deadlines, all of which were indicated in the Course Calendar for the semester. This gave students the freedom to manage their time as they needed to, which is crucial for students balancing multiple courses and other responsiblities.
												</p>
												
												<h3>Encourage good online learning practices.</h3>
												<p>
													I realized a few weeks into the semester that I needed to be a bit more proactive in sharing tips for succeeding in online courses with my students. It occurred to me that I was basing most of my expectations on my own experience taking online classes in undergrad, but I shouldn’t assume that my students automatically know things that I had to be taught. For example, recommending that students have a dedicated space to attend synchronous class sessions and encouraging students to use their webcams (if comfortable, of course) are things I wish I’d have done early on. Because I teach math, I also wish that I would have better emphasized the value of keeping a physical notebook of written mathematical work, even when the homework assignments were online through the Pearson MyLab & Mastering platform. Even if students have heard the advice before, reminders never hurt.
												</p>
												
												<h3>It doesn’t all have to be about course content.</h3>
												<p>
													Many of us have the unique experience of being able to teach from our homes, and for me this provided the ability to add a personal touch. I am currently obsessed with succulents and house plants, so once a week at the beginning of class, I would pluck a pot off my shelf of indoor plants, hold it up to my webcam, and share what was cool about it. They seemed to get a kick out of it. (One day, a few students even brought their own plants to share.) 
												</p>
												<p>	
													Another marvelous idea shared by a colleague was to play music in the Zoom meeting for five or ten minutes before the start of class, so I put together a tentative playlist and decided to give it a go. I got a lot of positive feedback from students who said that they “enjoyed the morning tunes,” and it was cool when they recognized favorites. Next semester, I’m going to find a way for them to share suggestions for the playlist to add their own flair.
												</p>
												<p>	
													The point is, if you can find some points of connection beyond the course content, it has the potential to foster a really cool classroom environment. It did for me!
												</p>
												
												<h3>Use check-in surveys to feel the pulse of the class.</h3>
												<p>
													The most valuable takeaway from this semester for me personally was the benefit of conducting informal feedback surveys with my students to see how they were doing in the course. After the first unit of material, I shared a link to a Google Form with a few basic, open-ended questions:
												</p>
												<ol>	
													<li>What aspects of the course do you like so far and find most helpful to your learning?</li>
													<li>What suggestions do you have for improvements or adjustments to the course?</li>
													<li>Anything else you’d like to share?</li>
												</ol>
												<p>	
													In the class period before I shared the survey, I held a class discussion with the first two prompts to get them thinking about how the course was going and what might better support them in their learning. I was honest in saying that I wouldn’t be able to incorporate all their suggestions, but that I wanted to have the conversation anyway to see if there was anything that I could reasonably adapt based on the needs of the class. 
												</p>
												<p>
													The survey accomplished the intended goal, which was to get some feedback on the course structure itself. They had some really good ideas. But this survey did something deeper – it helped me develop a better rapport with my students. From that point in the course on, students seemed more willing to reach out and connect during class. Several students shared how grateful they were that I even asked for their input because it made them feel as though they were a valued member of the course. As a result, I conducted additional feedback surveys at key points later in the semester to check in. They were so insightful!
												</p>
												<h3>In Summary...</h3>
												<p>
													During a semester when we're separated by screens and fostering student-instructor relationships can be challenging, looking back on some of the things that helped create a comfortable online learning environment gives me hope that future semesters affected by COVID-19 will seem a little less bleak. While I sincerely miss having in-person interactions with my students, I find comfort reflecting on the positive virtual interactions that took place this semester and am excited to continue refining my teaching practice to provide future students with a similar positive experience this spring.
