												<p>
													After a winter break that didn’t seem nearly long enough, in early January it was once again time to open up my laptop, don a headset, and sit tight for another online semester. Spring 2021 was met with equal amounts of exhaustion at the prospect of teaching remotely again and excitement about putting the lessons learned from last semester into practice. In the Fall, I shared some of my <a href="2020-12-16-pandemic-pedagogy.html">takeaways</a> as I reflected on my teaching experience as a first-year, full-time faculty member. In the same spirit of sharing experiences, here are some reflections on Spring 2021.
												</p>
																								
												<h3>Disconnect: The art of setting boundaries.</h3>
												<p>
													I did something insane this semester and turned off work email notifications on my cell phone. Crazy, right? I have always expressed to my students that they should feel free to email me any time, knowing that I will typically respond the next morning if the email is sent after 6 PM. However, while I still stand by that open invitation, I did not realize how much the constant pinging of my email throughout the day constantly fueled my anxiety and sense of being constantly behind. While I certainly intended to only respond during normal business hours, knowing that I had emails piling up in the evenings was taxing. 
												</p>
												<p>
													So I disconnected. I initially worried that disabling email notifications on my phone would cause me to miss something important. But, ever since going out on a limb hesitantly unchecking the setting to "Allow Notifications," I’ve noticed that the times when I intentionally sit down to respond to emails are much more efficient, and students still commented after I’d made the switch that they appreciated my responsiveness to emails. I’m glad my fears were unfounded, because it’s given me so much peace of mind back and improved my relationship with work.
												</p>
												
												<h3>Reflect: Noticing the common themes.</h3>
												<p>
													As probably evidenced by this post, I am a <i>huge</i> fan of keeping a reflection journal of one’s teaching experience. During my years teaching as a graduate student, when it came time to plan the next semester, I would always draw a blank on the things that I did (or didn’t) want to repeat. Journaling regularly, even if just a few scattered phrases on a sticky note slapped into a notebook with a date, has helped me notice some common themes that show up week-to-week.
												</p>
												<p>
													For example, looking through my notes from this semester, I realized that Friday at 11:59 PM assignment deadlines did not work for me. I went into the semester with the expectation for students to ask questions about assignments, but also had planned to not check my email after 5 PM on Fridays. These two expectations turned out to be in tension with one another, as students often had the most questions on Friday evenings leading up to the deadline. I now know to choose a deadline that better facilitates both goals. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I also learned which educational technology tools made my life easier by noticing patterns in how often I mentioned them in my weekly reflections. For instance, I discovered that I LOVE <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>, an online system for managing and grading written homework that I started using this semester. (If you teach math and haven’t yet heard about Gradescope yet, I highly recommend checking it out!) Nearly every week, I had a comment written in the margins about how much I liked a certain feature or how much easier grading was compared to last Fall. Seeing Gradescope show up throughout my reflections helped me recognize that this is one tool that should go on my "definitely will use again" list.
												</p>
																	
												<h3>Reconnect: The personal connections matter.</h3>
												<p>
													I am so proud to be a teacher when I see my students learning calculus and statistics or making connections between mathematics and the world around them. But I consider teaching math to be only half of my job, while the other half is community building. So I spend a good bit of time thinking about how to encourage student-instructor and student-student relationships.
												</p>
												<p>
													In my <a href="2020-12-16-pandemic-pedagogy.html">reflection from last Fall</a>, I mentioned how valuable I found the use of feedback surveys with my students. This semester, I formally built these surveys into students’ course grades to regularly check in with the class and help foster some of those connections in the virtual classroom. For example, one week I asked students to submit <a href="https://twitter.com/MissVagnozzi/status/1386470247805460482">memes</a> telling me how their semester was going. It was a hit, and while fun and lighthearted, it gave me a really good feel for how students were surviving another online semester. After that, many of them seemed more willing to open up and share if they were going through a rough patch.
												</p>
												<p>
													I also asked the class to help me build a <a href="http://bit.ly/MathStatSpotify">Spotify playlist</a> with their favorite music suggestions, which I played in the Zoom room during the ten minutes before class. Students went nuts when they heard their favorites playing, and it encouraged some lively conversation in the Zoom chat about how much they loved Taylor Swift or country music. Encouraging student interaction was a challenge last semester, and it was exciting to see that tapping into students' shared music interests was enough to break the ice and nudge them to connect with one another.
												</p>
												<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
												<p>
													Like many who started new full-time lecturer positions last Fall, teaching fully online in the middle of a pandemic was not what I had pictured for my first year as a faculty member. The relief that the academic year is over is immense. Nevertheless, I'm glad that, scattered throughout this stressful first year have been a myriad of positive learning experiences. While I'm personally looking forward to leaving online classes behind for a good long while and returning to the classroom, I'm excited to see how this process of disconnecting from work, reflecting on my teaching practice, and reconnecting with students with renewed energy plays out when things look a little more "normal."
